Heap::Simple
============

DESCRIPTION

A heap is a partially sorted structure where it's always easy to extract the
smallest element. If the collection of elements is changing dynamically, a
heap has less overhead than keeping the collection fully sorted.

The order in which equal elements get extracted is unspecified.

The main order relations supported by this module are "<" (numeric compare)
and "lt" (string compare).

The module allows you to manage data where the elements are of several
allowed types, in particular array references, hash references, objects
or just the keys themselves.

The internals of the module do nothing with the elements inserted except
inspecting the key. This means that if you for example store a blessed
object, that's what you will get back on extract. It's also ok to keep
references to the elements around and make changes to them while they are
in the heap as long as you don't change the key.

SYNOPSIS

    use Heap::Simple;

    # Create a heap
    my $heap = Heap::Simple;
    my $heap = Heap::Simple->new(%options);

    # Put data in the heap
    $heap->insert($element);
    # Put data in a "Object" or "Any" heap with a given key
    $heap->key_insert($key, $element);

    # Extract data
    $element = $heap->extract_top;

    # Extract all data whose key is not above a given value
    @elements = $heap->extract_upto($max_key);

    # Look which data is first without extracting
    $element = $heap->first;

    # Find the lowest value in the heap
    $top_key = $heap->first_key;  # returns undef   on an empty heap
    $top_key = $heap->top_key;	  # return infinity on an empty heap

    # Find the key corresponding to a value
    $key = $heap->key($value);

    # Find the number of elements
    $count = $heap->count;

    # Empty the heap
    $heap->clear;

    # Get all keys (not sorted)
    @keys = $heap->keys;
    # Get all values (not sorted)
    @values = $heap->values;

    # Get/Set user_data
    $user_data  = $heap->user_data;
    $old_data   = $heap->user_data($new_data);

    # Get/Set infinity
    $infinity     = $heap->infinity;
    $old_infinity = $heap->infinity($new_data);

    # Get the position of a key in an element
    $key_index    = $heap->key_index;
    $key_name     = $heap->key_name;
    $key_method   = $heap->key_method;
    $key_function = $heap->key_function;
