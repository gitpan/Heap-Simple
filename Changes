Revision history for Perl extension Heap::Simple.

Plan:
  - Deleting
  - Tied interface
  - Special handling for duplicate keys (error, share, overwrite, separate)

        - Don't scare away users by directly explaining all possibilities in
          the docs. Add examples to the top to show basic usage.
        - Fix author email.
        - Be paranoid about defining an expanded function twice.
        - Rename extract_min to extract_top (like Heap did). Keep
          extract_min around for backward compatibility. Same with top_key
          (used to be min_key)
        - Move Simple.pm into lib/Heap
        - Allow Simple.pm and package version to be different

        - reorder s.t to take much less memory (failed on fast machines with
          little memory).
        - Added keys, values and clear methods, with tests and documentation

0.04  2003-05-19
        - Small documentation changes
        - Bugfix: "Any" and "Object" element types without arguments failed

0.03  2003-05-19
        - Added settable infinity
        - Added generic compare function
        - min_key now always exists, but can fail on empty heaps
        - reordered $self->[0] from most to least likely
        - Added the Object and Any element methods
        - Added testcases for element methods Method, Object, Function and Any
        - Added method "key_insert"
        - Added testcases for generic compare
        - Added method "key"
        - Documented all new stuff
        - Reduce the number of tests. Still way too many though.

0.02  2003-05-15
        - Added testcases for > and gt
        - Cleaned up the tests a bit
        - Do a bit less work in the tests (faster)
        - autocalibrate the big benchmark test.
        - Unify n.t and s.t. Only run the number variant by default.
        - Unify 2.t into 1.t
        - changed the macro-expander so it supports balanced parenthesis
        - Added the Method and Function element types for completely general
          key fetching (not documented or tested yet)

0.01  2003-05-14
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-X -n Heap::Simple
        - Insert code from my old FastHeap module
        - Slight code changes
        - Make special versions (Plain, Array, Hash)
        - add testcases
        - Prepare for release
        - Module set too simular, names too confusing. Refactor module names
          into arguments.
        - remove perl 5.6 dependencies (untested)
        - Prepare for release again.
